## Project 4

- 📊 **A/B Testing Project**: I had one last project for Eniac. This time directly affected revenue generation, the Data team evaluated a test on which version of a website feature converts more visits to sales.

  A common challenge of internet companies is to increase conversions through a better User Interface (an appealing design) and User Experience (intuitive and usable interactions). This is initially a task for the Design team, but once visitors start to flow, purchases begin to happen and designers are out of improvement ideas, it is time for the Data Analytics team to step in and support improvements through rigorous experimentation.

If a funnel takes into account actions that a company might be taking even before a potential customer has heard of them, or after a purchase is made, it can be called a “Marketing Funnel”.

- 📑 **Case Study to Data Analysis**:
    
    In an A/B test, we compare the performance of two or more versions of a site. When designing the experiment, several questions can emerge.

How many different versions should be tested?
What kind of changes can we implement in each version of the test (from changing just the colour of a button to redesigning the whole site)?
How can we show one version to a selected group of users and another version to a different group?
Which metric should we choose to compare the different versions?
Should Eniac experiment with other elements of the site instead (or in addition to) the “SHOP NOW” button?
How can we track, store, and analyze the data from each version?
How can we ever be sure that the version with the best performance does not have more clicks due to just chance?
How long can we expect the experiment to last?


- 💻 **Project Setup**:
    
    - 🐍 Requires Python with libraries Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.
    - 📓 Utilizes Jupyter Notebooks for each chapter to facilitate learning.
    - Sample T-test
    - Chi-Squared Test
