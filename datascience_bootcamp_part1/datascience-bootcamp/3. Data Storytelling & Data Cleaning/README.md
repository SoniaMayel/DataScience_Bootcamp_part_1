## Project 3: Eniac_Discount Decision

- 📊 **Data Cleaning & Storytelling Project**: A project involving data preparation and analysis using Python's Pandas library.
- 📑 **Case Study to Data Analysis**:
    
    - 🧐 Starts with a real-world case study for practical experience, about Eniac, a fictional company who is asking their data analysts 
      whether discounts are worth or not. For this, we had access to internal data from Eniac, but a bit more chaotic! ([data](data)) I had to assess 
      the data quality of the dataset and did a lot of data cleansing tasks before I could deal with the business issues.
    - 🛠️ Includes cleaning techniques ([data](notebooks/3.2.2_data_cleaning_with_pandas_solutions.ipynb)) like handling missing data and type corrections.
    - 📆 Covers datetime manipulation ([data](notebooks/3.2.3_datetime_solutions.ipynb))  and data grouping ([data](notebooks/3.2.4_groupby_solutions.ipynb)) for trend analysis.
    - 🔍 Focuses on data quality ([data](notebooks/3.2.5_quality_assessment_sample_solution.ipynb)) checks and integrity validation.
    - 📈 Teaches data analysis for insightful storytelling.
      
 The main business questions:
- How should products be classified into different categories to simplify reports and analysis?
- What is the distribution of product prices across different categories?
- How many products are being discounted?
- How big are the offered discounts as a percentage of the product prices?
- How do seasonality and special dates (Christmas, Black Friday) affect sales?
- How could data collection be improved?

I worked on this group project together with:

- [Marvin Lipps](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marvinlipps/)
- [Imen Abidi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/imen-abidi/)

- 💻 **Project Setup**:
    
    - 🐍 Requires Python with libraries Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib ([data](notebooks/3.2.7_seaborn_solutions.ipynb)).
    - 📓 Utilizes Jupyter Notebooks for each chapter to facilitate learning ([notebooks](notebooks)).
 
  ## Presentation

Together with the material of my group colleagues and after rehearsal and feedback from our trainers, we condensed our findings into a five-minute presentation ([slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MPa_HvmKrdFmtEEDeydOona56EiJ2zR2vP6IUCg3AE0/edit#slide=id.p)).
